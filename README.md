# Employee_Retirement_Analysis

## Overview of Project
In this project we were charged with determining the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Analysis and Results
 - The first step was to create a table containing the employees by title who were born between January 1, 1952, and December 31, 1955. This allows us to count the number of retirement age employees by job title.

- As we can see below the total of employees from this calendar range is 133,776.

- The retiring_title table shows us that most of the employees retiring have Senior titles.

- The final step of our analysis was to provide what employees are eligible for a mentorship program based on birthdates between January 1, 1965, and December 31, 1965. The chart below is an example of that table.

## Conclusion
In the graphic below we see that the total number of mentorship eligible employees is roughly 1,500.

With roughly 62% of the workforce at retirement age and only about 1% capable of mentorship we strongly suggest broadening the mentorship eligibility requirements to query for a retirement timeframe as there might not be enough employees to fulfill the mentorship roles prior to retirement.

An additional query could contain the number of years spent in a specific role to allow more insight into how the mentorship program could be optimized.
